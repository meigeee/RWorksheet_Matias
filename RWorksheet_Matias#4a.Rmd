Worksheet#4a

#1.The table below shows the data about shoe size and height. Create a data frame.
DATA <- data.frame (ShoeSize=c(6.5,9.0,8.5,8.5,10.5,7.0,9.5,9.0,13.0,7.5,10.5,8.5,12.0,10.5,13.0,11.5,8.5,5.0,10.0,6.5,7.5,8.5,10.5,8.5,10.5,11.0,9.0,13.0),

Height=c(66.0,68.0,64.5,65.0,70.0,64.0,70.0,71.0,72.0,64.0,74.5,67.0,71.0,71.0,77.0,72.0,59.0,62.0,72.0,66.0,64.0,67.0,73.0,69.0,72.0,70.0,69.0,70.0),

Gender=c("F","F","F","F","M","F","F","F","M","F","M","F","M","M","M","M","F","F","M","F","F","M","M","F","M","M","M","M"))

DATA 
  
#a. Describe the data.
#The data has 28 entries with 3 columns
#First Column shows Shoe_Size
#Second Column displays Height
#Third column shows Gender

#b.Create a subset by males and females with their corresponding shoe size and height.
malesub <- DATA[DATA$Gender == "M", c("ShoeSize", "Height", "Gender")]
malesub
femalesub <- DATA[DATA$Gender == "F", c("ShoeSize", "Height", "Gender")]
femalesub
#c. Find the mean of shoe size and height of the respondents.
Shoes <- mean(DATA$ShoeSize)
Shoes
Heights<- mean(DATA$Height)
Heights
#d. Is there a relationship between shoe size and height? Why?
#Yes
#Shoe size generally is proportional to height.
#We can expect people with large feet to be taller.

#2. Construct character vector months to a factor with factor() and assign the result to factor_months_vector.

months <- c("March","April","January","November","January","September","October","September","November","August","January","November","November","February","May","August","July","December","August","August","September","November","February","April")
months
factor_months_vector <- factor(months)
factor_months_vector

#3. Then check the summary() of the months_vector and factor_months_vector. Inter-pret the results of both vectors. Are they both equally useful in this case?

summary(months)
summary(factor_months_vector)
# In the summary of months, it shows the number of length, class, and mode of the vector. 
# In the summary of factor_months_vector, it shows the frequency of each months.
# Both are useful in different cases where the no. of length, class, mode, or the frequency is needed.

#4.Create a vector and factor for the table below.
factor_freq <- c(1,4,3)
factor_vector <- c("East", "West","North")
new_factor_vector <- factor(factor_vector,levels = c("East","West","North"))
print(new_factor_vector)

#5.Enter the data below in Excel with file name = import_march.csv
write.csv(import_march, file = "import_march.csv")
file_path <- "/cloud/project/import_march.csv"
imported_table <- read.csv(file = file_path, header = TRUE, sep = ",")
View(imported_table)

#6. Full Search
rannum <- readline(prompt = "Enter number from 1 to 50: ")
rannum <- as.numeric(rannum)
paste("The number you have chosen is", rannum)
if (rannum > 50) {
  paste("The number selected is beyond the range of 1 to 50")
} else if (rannum== 20) {
  paste("TRUE")
} else {
  paste(rannum)
}

#7. Change
minibills <- function(price) {
  
  minbills <- price %/% 50
  paste("The minimum no. of bills:", minbills)
}
minibills(90)

#8a.Create a dataframe from the above table.
names <- c("Annie", "Thea", "Steve", "Hanna")
grade1 <- c(85,65,75,95)
grade2 <- c(65,75,55,75)
grade3 <- c(85,90,80,100)
grade4 <- c(100,90,85,90)
mathgrades <- data.frame(
  Name = names,
  Grade1 = grade1,
  Grade2 = grade2,
  Grade3 = grade3,
  Grade4 = grade4
)
mathgrades

#8b. Without using the rowMean function, output the average score of students whose average math score over 90 points during the semester.
                   

#8c. Without using the mean function, output as follows for the tests in which the average score was less than 80 out of 4 tests.


#8d. Without using the max function, output as follows for students whose highest score for a semester exceeds 90 points.
