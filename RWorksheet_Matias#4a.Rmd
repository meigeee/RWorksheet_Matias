Worksheet#4a

#1.The table below shows the data about shoe size and height. Create a data frame.
DATA <- data.frame (ShoeSize=c(6.5,9.0,8.5,8.5,10.5,7.0,9.5,9.0,13.0,7.5,10.5,8.5,12.0,10.5,13.0,11.5,8.5,5.0,10.0,6.5,7.5,8.5,10.5,8.5,10.5,11.0,9.0,13.0),

Height=c(66.0,68.0,64.5,65.0,70.0,64.0,70.0,71.0,72.0,64.0,74.5,67.0,71.0,71.0,77.0,72.0,59.0,62.0,72.0,66.0,64.0,67.0,73.0,69.0,72.0,70.0,69.0,70.0),

Gender=c("F","F","F","F","M","F","F","F","M","F","M","F","M","M","M","M","F","F","M","F","F","M","M","F","M","M","M","M"))

DATA 
  
#a. Describe the data.
#The data has 28 entries with 3 columns
#First Column shows Shoe_Size
#Second Column displays Height
#Third column shows Gender

#b.Create a subset by males and females with their corresponding shoe size and height.
malesub <- DATA[DATA$Gender == "M", c("ShoeSize", "Height", "Gender")]
malesub
femalesub <- DATA[DATA$Gender == "F", c("ShoeSize", "Height", "Gender")]
femalesub
#c. Find the mean of shoe size and height of the respondents.
Shoes <- mean(DATA$ShoeSize)
Shoes
Heights<- mean(DATA$Height)
Heights
#d. Is there a relationship between shoe size and height? Why?

#2. Construct character vector months to a factor with factor() and assign the result to factor_months_vector.

                   


#3. Then check the summary() of the months_vector and factor_months_vector. | Inter-pret the results of both vectors. Are they both equally useful in this case?
