#1.There is a built-in vector
LETTERS
letters
#a. You need to produce a vector that contains the first 11 letter.
LETTERS[1:11]
letters[1:11]
#b. Produce a vector that contains the odd numbered letters.
LETTERS[x=seq(1,26,by=2)]

#c.Produce a vector that contains the vowels
vowels <- LETTERS[c(1,5,9,15,21)]
vowels

#d. Produce a vector that contains the last 5 lowercase letters.

ending <- letters[c(22:26)]

#e. Produce a vector that contains letters between 15 to 24 letters in lowercase.

#2 Create a vector(not a dataframe).
#a.What is the R code and its result for creating a character vector

#b. The average temperatures in Celcius

#c. Create a dataframe to combine the city and the temp by using â€˜data.frame().
